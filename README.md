# PaintWithJS
PaintWithJS is an online Microsoft Paint like tool, that allows it's users to plan for emergency routes before the disaster strikes.

This repository is currently under construction. Once it is finished I will make a proper ReadMe document with some images to illustrate the programme.

For now if you have any questions or feedback feel free to contact me.
